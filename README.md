# binary-clock-arduino
### An interesting clock that takes time setting in binary and rings with a very "jugaadu" bell
### It has two modes:
- **Alarm Clock Mode**: Initialise the clock at 12AM, set a time in 24hr format on the binary input for the alarm to go-off at.
- **Timer**: Set a time (in minutes) on the binary input, and press the red button to start the timer.
